# Capstone-Project-SQL-Murder-Mystery-Who-Killed-the-CEO-
SQL investigation project using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to cross‑match evidence from keycard logs, alibi claims, and call records. Builds a dashboard‑style query to flag employees by movements, false alibis, and suspicious calls, then combines findings to identify the killer through multi‑condition matching.
